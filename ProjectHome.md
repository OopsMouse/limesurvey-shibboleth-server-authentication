This is an extention to Limesurvey adding Shibboleth authentication.

Note that authentication is done by the web server and that the identity provider is not called directly.

While authentication has been implemented for Shibboleth any other authentication methods done at the web server level should work as well.

Project contains a template for SWITCH.
